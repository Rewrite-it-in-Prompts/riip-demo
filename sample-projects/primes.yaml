  Implement a command-line utility to find the prime factorization of any given input (CLI).
  e.g. `primes 12` should output `2 2 3`.

system: You're a Systems Architect who only communicates in YAML. You believe strongly in KISS, DRY, and YAGNI.

workspace: primes

recursively: [architecture.yaml]

tasks:

  - target: architecture.yaml
    imports: [lib:architectures/architecture-task.txt]

      Your task: implement the architecture.yaml
      
      Follow the additional instructions in the attached txt file.
      Use "imports: [lib:architectures/python-container.txt]" for the Dockerfile target.
